        Fashion is the most general term and applies to any way of dressing, behaving, writing, or performing that is
        favored at any one time or place.
        <br>
        The current fashion style often implies a distinctive fashion adopted by people of taste.

        Fashion Trend Cycle Introduction Background The fashion apparel industry has significantly evolved, particularly
        within the last 20 years. The changing dynamics of the fashion industry have forced retailers to desire low cost
        and flexibility in design, quality, and speed to market, key strategies to maintain a profitable position in the
        increasingly demanding market. The fashion industry has the introduction and emergence of a concept of
        ‘throwaway’, I know most of top business houses around the world totally rely on designers for understanding the
        same, but on the other side there are others who dont believe in it at all. In current times when we look at
        technology we know nothing is by chance and there are people who are working behind the scenes, day and night to
        make things appear easy and affordable to us. Question which often comes to our mind is which trend forecast to
        use and how we can understand it better. Many technological forecasting methods have been reported in various
        forecast related books & mentioned in literature of many countries, and they have been successfully applied
        widely. As trend forecasting results are mainly influenced by the forecasting method used by the end user, it is
        of utmost importance to determine the method that will be most appropriate to a business model you adopt.

                enhancing one’s beauty. It also symbolizes wealth, power, and status. For some, jewelry is a form of art
                for self and creative expression. Then, there are some people who use jewelry as part of their tradition
                and culture. Though they may differ in terms of importance and relevance, they all play significant
                roles.

                Significance of Jewelries in Indian Culture

                For the Indian culture, jewelries plays a symbolic role. They carry ethnic and spiritual meanings,
                especially during weddings. The pieces of jewelries worn by the bride signifies that she is to become a
                part of her husband’s extended family. They are a part of the purification ritual as she becomes a part
                of the extended family of her bridegroom.
                <br>

                "Fashion is a non-verbal way of communication that conveys a lot about the person’s personality,
                background and style. It makes people feel confident and bold. People can express themselves openly."

                <br>

                Fashion is important because it reflects the culture of a country. It makes our life colourful and
                changes our life with time. In a way it also adds variety to life, providing an opportunity in trying
                out something new.
